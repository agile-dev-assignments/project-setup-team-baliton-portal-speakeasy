### The Project's Values and Team Norms, Including the Definition of "Done":
We value good functional work over hasty buggy implementations.
We value agile software development and hold scrum meetings twice a week, tuesday and saturday starting at 13:00 est.
The definition of done for Speakeasy is to have a functional web application where users can create and join encrypted, many-user calls while remaining anonymous and having no permanent data tracked.
### The Git Workflow That the Team Follows:
Each team member will fork/pull the most recent copy of the repository to their own devices. 
For each task team members will create their own branch on their local repository
Once a spike or task is complete team members merge that branch into their pulled up-to-date main branch, and then merge-request to the project repository.
NOT USING: Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
### Contributing Rules
When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.
Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.
### Resolution of Conflicts:
Disagreements and conflicts among team members will be resolved at scrum meetings, whether they be the standard bi-weekly ones, or special impromptu meetings made for time sensitive issues or disagreements. These disagreements will be resolved first through discussion, and if no resolution is made by both parties, the team will vote on how to proceed.
### Instructions for Setting Up the Local Development Environment in Order to Work on Speakeasy:
Team members should first fork a copy of the project repository to their own github.
Team members will then copy the main branch of their own fork to their local desktop environment.
Create a new branch for each task, remembering to pull the most recent copy of the repository before commiting
### Instructions for Building/Testing 
Pull github repo onto local machine. Run npm install in folders react/front-end and react/back-end. Then add .env file to react/back-end with database credentials and run npm start in both react/front-end and react/backend (with seperate terminals).
