## Product Vision Statement
Speakeasy is an audio chat room application that runs directly in the browser. It will utilize the RingRTC library to support low-latency real-time communication.The app aims to provide a platform for people to discuss and debate sensitive topics whilst remaining anonymous. With Speakeasy the users privacy and anonymity comes first. This app is designed for the free thinker. Every person should have the freedom and ability to think, debate and exchange with others. Speakeasy aims to facilitate that.

### A Short History of Speakeasy and How to Contribute
This project was inspired by the Clubhouse app. We wanted to address specific shortcomings of clubhouse and create an alternative that is more anonymous while being more accessible to the public. We will develop Speakeasy as a website that is optimized for mobile devices. The tool we use will likely include React (javascript), mongoDB, and the RingRTC library. We will start with creating the base individual webpages. Then we will create and connect the database. Finally, the audio, authentication, and other miscellaneous components will be added and polished. Each group member will test each added functionality at the end of each sprint.
