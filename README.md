               This project was inspired by the Clubhouse app. We wanted to 
               
               address specific shortcomings of clubhouse and create an 
               
               alternative that is more anonymous while being more 
               
               accessible to the public. We will develop Speakeasy 
               
               as a website that is optimized for mobile devices. 
               
               The tool we use will likely include React (javascript), 
               
               mongoDB, and webRTC. We will start with creating the 
               
               base individual webpages. Then we will create and 
               
               connect the database. Finally, the audio, authentication,
               
               and other miscellaneous components will be added and polished. 
               
               Each group member will test each added functionality at 
               
               the end of each sprint.
